# Earth Textures

This directory should contain Earth texture files for the best visual quality.

## Recommended Textures

Place the following textures here (JPEG format, 2K-8K resolution):

- `earth_day.jpg` - Earth day texture (diffuse/albedo)
- `earth_night.jpg` - Earth night lights (emissive)
- `earth_normal.jpg` - Normal map for terrain detail
- `earth_specular.jpg` - Specular/water mask (white = reflective oceans)
- `earth_clouds.jpg` - Cloud layer (alpha/transparency)

## Fallback

If no textures are provided, the application will use procedural textures as fallback. The app will work without texture files, but won't look as realistic.

## File Size Considerations

- **4K textures**: Good balance (recommended for web)
- **8K textures**: Best quality but larger files
- **2K textures**: Fastest loading, acceptable quality

Choose based on your target audience and hosting capabilities.
